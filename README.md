# Automatic-Attendance

Need for this project : 
	The previous attendance system which was installed in school, colleges and offices for the attendance of staffs required them to physically touch the device to record their attendance, which was not very practical to do considering the pandemic so this system was made in order avoid touching anything this system will detect the faces of people using camera and will mark the attendance in the database.
This system can also be used in online classes for students as well as company meetings.
